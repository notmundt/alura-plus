## About

This repository is the result of the following course:

- [ðŸ“š HTML and CSS: practicing HTML/CSS](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html-css-praticando-html-css)

The goal of the course taught by instructor [**Monica Hillman**](https://github.com/MonicaHillman) was to create a single page for **Alura Plus** following the layout predefined in **Figma**.

## Changes

I have changed the content of the page (and its respective classes) to **English**, you can view the layout in figma [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/KTBHOBMij5IB4OXmhIQcgY/Alura-Plus---English).

## Preview

You can see a live demo of the site right here:
